<p data-bo="158">The <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-research/about">Nature weekly journal of
science</a> was first published in 1869. And after one and a half century, it has finally completed one cycle of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">carcinization</a>, by publishing
an article about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">the Rust programming language</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="499">It’s a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">really good article</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="582">What I liked about this article is that it didn’t <em>just</em> talk about
performance, or even just memory safety - it also talked about correctness.</p>

<p data-bo="727">Well, it also talked about diversity and inclusion, which I think is also
extremely important, but it’s not an <em>intrinsic</em> quality of the language,
more of a state of affairs - which we cannot take for granted, as the nature
of human dynamics is that they are… dynamic.</p>

<p data-bo="1000">{% sc amossays %}
Which is not to say that the quality of the community around Rust, those who
build, use, and teach Rust, does not affect the quality of the language
itself. Quite the contrary. What I <em>am</em> saying, is that if we are not
careful, a community can rapidly degrade, especially as a language gains
wider adoption.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="1339">{% sc bearsays %}
Right! It’s not quite as simple as “one bad apple spoils the bunch”, it’s
more about eventual moderator burnout.</p>

<p data-bo="1471">I mean, if you just take a look at Re-
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="1523">{% sc amossays %}
Uhhh moving on
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="1569">{% sc bearsays %}
…fine.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="1609">With all that said - I don’t feel especially qualified to discuss that topic
at length right now (possibly ever), which is why for today, I’ll try to
remain focused on the notion of correctness.</p>

<a id="the-challenges-of-rust-advocacy" href="#the-challenges-of-rust-advocacy" class="anchor"><h2>The challenges of Rust advocacy</h2></a>
<p data-bo="1841">Whenever the topic of Rust comes up, it’s usually in comparison with some
other language. And quite often (to the chagrin of many in the community),
the conversation devolves into a series of arguments about why some piece of
software ought to be written (or rewritten) in Rust.</p>

<p data-bo="2121">This pattern is so common, it has become a meme - with its own acronym: RIIR,
for “Rewrite It In Rust”. If you put those words in a search engine you’ll
find no shortage of articles explaining why you should - or shouldn’t - RIIR.</p>

<p data-bo="2353">But apart from their frequency and length, there is something else that’s
extremely common about these arguments. The “do RIIR” side, despite their
best efforts, is frequently perceived by the other side as being “superior”
or “elitist”.</p>

<p data-bo="2592">This is made worse by articles in the style of “I tried to RIIR, and it
didn’t work out for me”, which usually leads to one of several conclusions,
some of which are: “the promises made by Rust were not upheld”, or “the
author went about this all wrong”, neither of which are particularly good
press for, well, Rust.</p>

<p data-bo="2910">I’ve tried to pinpoint what exactly about Rust “evangelism” makes it seem so
unpalatable to folks who are perfectly comfortable using the languages
they’ve been using for years (sometimes decades), and I’ve come to an
explanation I’m reasonably happy with.</p>

<p data-bo="3168">It comes in the form of a collection of statements, all of which I believe
are true simultaneously:</p>

<p data-bo="3269"><strong>1) Programming in Rust requires you to think differently</strong></p>

<p data-bo="3331">This has several implications: first, trying to replicate patterns that are
common in other languages is often bound to fail spectacularly. This makes
the learning experience quite frustrating for some, and is in itself enough
to explain why a lot of the “I tried to RIIR” articles end up the way they
do.</p>

<p data-bo="3638">To an “outsider” (someone who has never written Rust), this statement alone
also <em>already</em> feels superior. If you’ve gone through the wonderful
experience of getting a new manager who feels like they need to change
everything slightly just to assert their position - this is what it <em>can</em>
feel like.</p>

<p data-bo="3939">{% sc amossays %}
That feeling tends to dissipate after persevering for a period of time. What
once appeared as petty “calls to authority”, changes for changes’ sake, are
eventually almost all revealed to be <em>fundamental</em> changes, that are
necessary to make the whole system work.</p>

<p data-bo="4221">And sometimes they’re just current limitations of the language and&#x2F;or its
implementations. That’s something the C++ crowd runs into a lot more.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="4378">{% sc bearsays %}
Wait, implementations, plural? I thought Rust had no spec and there was only
one compiler?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="4500">{% sc amossays %}
Arguably, <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a> is a partial
reimplementation of a lot of the language. Inside rustc itself, there are
several concurrent implementations of the same components.</p>

<p data-bo="4725">See for example <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">Polonius</a>, the
next-generation borrow checker, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>
interpreter, or the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">Cranelift codegen
backend</a>.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="4987">This statement is equally irritating to the functional programming crowd, who
are <em>already</em> enamored with languages that requires them to think
differently, sometimes much more differently, than “traditional” languages
like, C, C++, Java, Python, Go, etc.</p>

<p data-bo="5244">{% sc amossays %}
“Traditional” is put in scare quotes here because of course, functional
programming languages are not particularly recent. I’m (mis)using it in the
sense “that you would find a lot of job openings for in the past decade”.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="5497">“No”, say the Haskellers, understandably, “Rust is <em>not</em> a ‘fundamental’
departure from ‘’‘traditional’‘’ imperative programming languages, in fact,
look at it, and its filthy, filthy side effects”.</p>

<p data-bo="5697">To which I say: fair. But also: <strong>the novelty is in the compromise</strong>. If you
can find a way to reconcile two fundamentally different but well-established
methods, you’ve made something new, that solves a new category of problems,
or that solves more easily an old category of problems - at any rate: it’s
worth looking into.</p>

<p data-bo="6023"><strong>2) It is harder to write any code at all in Rust</strong></p>

<p data-bo="6077">Again, there are several ways to misconstrue this statement: I don’t believe
Rust is particularly harder to write, than, say, x86 assembly.</p>

<p data-bo="6218">{% sc bearsays %}
Or is it?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="6259">But it is, arguably, harder to write any code at all in Rust, than in Go, or
JavaScript. You can take a perfectly fine JavaScript program, and struggle
for <em>hours</em> to rewrite it in Rust, because the compiler <em>requires</em> you to
care about more aspects of the problem than you had to before.</p>

<p data-bo="6549">Which begs the question: why would anyone submit themselves to this?</p>

<p data-bo="6619">That is a completely fair question. Because in this instance, the JavaScript
program was “complete” before its Rust equivalent was, and they solved the
same problem. Sure, the Rust program may be faster - but is that enough of
a differentiator?</p>

<p data-bo="6865">We could have shipped the JavaScript program earlier, acquired customers, and
increased revenue. And we could’ve worried about “minor bugs” and
“performance difficulties” later on.</p>

<p data-bo="7047">Or so I’m being told.</p>

<p data-bo="7070">And as Rust is beginning to see wider adoption, not only in almost all of the
major software companies, but in a lot of the smaller ones as well, this is
an argument that real actual people like you and me are going over several
times a day, every day of the week, because we as an industry are not good
with the whole work&#x2F;life balance thingy.</p>

<p data-bo="7416"><strong>3) It is easier to write “correct” code in Rust</strong></p>

<p data-bo="7469">This is where things get tricky.</p>

<p data-bo="7503">Because “correct” is not an end goal. “Correct”, much like chaos, is a ladder.</p>

<p data-bo="7583">Unless you’re embarking on a mission to the moon, or you’re writing software
for self-driving cars, or… okay there’s actually quite a few applications
for which you do need to be “correct” - but say, if you’re working for a
company that sells a “non-essential” customer product or service (and that’s
most of the industry), you only need to be <em>correct enough</em>.</p>

<p data-bo="7948">Say you’re writing a music recommendation system. The correctness
requirements here are <em>extremely lax</em>. You could totally get away with just
pulling from the “most listened” titles dataset, and vaguely bucketing things
by year or genres. Not that anyone would actually do that. Wink wink.</p>

<p data-bo="8239">Point is: if 50% of your recommendations are only tangentially related to
your customer’s interests, it probably won’t hurt the bottom line. And
anyway: are they paying customers? Or are they just freeloaders making it up
by getting some ads shoved into their ears now and then? Maybe you could only
run the <em>real</em> recommendation system for those premium accounts.</p>

<p data-bo="8605">But I digress.</p>

<p data-bo="8621">There’s a <em>lot</em> of software applications for which being correct is not all
that important. Unless customers - paying customers - start to notice, and
straight up threaten to leave you for a competitor if you don’t fix the
incorrectness, presto.</p>

<p data-bo="8868">Let’s talk about uptime: the percentage of the time that a service is
“available”, or “healthy”. No one is foolish enough to promise 100% uptime.
We barely have enough control over matter to achieve <code>99.99%</code> uptime - and we
do so by building redundant systems. If a node won’t handle requests
properly, just fall back to another node, or take it out of rotation, set up
more load balancers, filter out the word “latency” on Slack, do something,
anything!</p>

<p data-bo="9324">And if you really <em>can’t</em> achieve the promised uptime, well, you still have a
way out: you can give the customer their money back, sort of, in the form of
a “credit”, which effectively makes their next bill a little lighter.</p>

<p data-bo="9550">But does that mean you shouldn’t care, or worry about correctness? No!</p>

<p data-bo="9622">{% sc bearsays %}
Today: Rhetorical questions 101, with Amos.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="9697">Every bit of incorrectness you ship has a cost. The most direct cost is
giving customers “credits” - you’re literally taking a chunk out of your own
profits, as penance for failing to meet your own goals.</p>

<p data-bo="9903">But fixing lots of “minor bugs” has an engineering cost, too. <em>Someone</em> has
to go through the backlog, or the ice box, or wherever kids store their
<del>plums</del> tickets nowadays, and actually ship the fix. And hope that their
fix does not introduce a regression.</p>

<p data-bo="10164">So you write tests. And then some more tests. And some of them are flaky,
because of the law of large numbers, or something like that. So you allow
them to fail. And then you find bugs in your tests, so you fix those bugs
too, but not after you’ve “fixed” your code so it passes the tests,
introducing an error because it turns out the <del>call was coming from inside
the house</del> test was wrong all along.</p>

<p data-bo="10569">And while your engineers are busy doing all this, they’re not working on new
features. Features that would be much faster to build originally in Go, or
JavaScript, or so I’m told. And so your company falls behind, as others
continue to innovate, which could eventually cost you your entire
marketshare.</p>

<p data-bo="10873">This is not a work of fiction - it’s something that has happened in all
industries, for as long as we’ve had industries.</p>

<p data-bo="10995">Of course, the reverse nightmare scenario is also real - we all know that one
colleague who, by our own estimation, spends “forever” trying to get
something juuuuuuuuust right. This can <em>also</em> cause a company to fall behind
while others continue innovating and capturing the market.</p>

<p data-bo="11279">So, as with a lot of things - it’s a balance.</p>

<p data-bo="11396">And if you’ve managed to not let yourself be distracted by the meanderings
the introduction to this article has taken, you might remember that I
mentioned Rust was a <em>compromise</em>, and so you may well have an inkling where
it is that I’m trying to go with all this.</p>

<p data-bo="11662">And you would be correct.</p>

<p data-bo="11689">{% sc bearsays %}

<a id="implicit-contracts-are-everywhere" href="#implicit-contracts-are-everywhere" class="anchor"><h2>Implicit contracts are everywhere</h2></a>
<p data-bo="11762">The world is a messy, <em>messy</em> place. Depending on how your brain apprehends
your surroundings, and your current mental state, the world can range from
“okay, I guess” to deeply upsetting.</p>

<p data-bo="11951">Social interactions are a perfect way to familiarize ourselves with the
notion of “implicit contracts”.</p>

<p data-bo="12056">It is understood, among good company, that there are certain things one ought
not to discuss out loud. Or not with people you don’t know well enough. Or
not with your family. Or not at all.</p>

<p data-bo="12247">This is part of a “social contract”, that I honestly don’t remember signing,
which is kinda bullshit if you want my opinion, but regardless - a large
number of scholars agree that it is, indeed, “a thing”, so let’s just go with
it.</p>

<p data-bo="12480">Kids in particular, tend to be frustrated by the vagueness of this social
contract. Kids, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-67hbucUjQ">Nathan
Fielder</a>, whose videos rarely
fail to make me laugh, but make others extremely uncomfortable, due to the
sheer awkwardness of not behaving like others expect you to, even in fairly
innocent situations.</p>

<p data-bo="12830">The thing about this “social contract”, apart from being poorly defined and
ever-evolving, is that there exists very little in the way of enforcing it.</p>

<p data-bo="12983">Ah, to be an edgy teenager again, discovering - for the first time in
history, no doubt - the idea that “if we all stop going to school, there is
nothing they can do about it”.</p>

<p data-bo="13161">{% sc bearsays %}
I’m sure that went well.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="13217">{% sc amossays %}
Well, it wasn’t as big a walkout as I had envisioned, but eventually
the school administration and I agreed that it was probably best if I
skipped certain classes for a while, so it all worked out in the end.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="13457">{% sc bearsays %}
I’m not sure you learned the right lesson from that, but discussing
incentives is probably best left for another day.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="13606">Anyway - the same “implicit contracts” apply to the tech world.</p>

<p data-bo="13671">For instance, it is generally agreed-upon that hammering a server with
hundreds of thousands of requests in a short period of time is “rude”.
But do it over it a period of ten years, and you’re a “valued customer”.</p>

<p data-bo="13887">Confusing, I know.</p>

<p data-bo="13907">And that’s not all. If a service listens for TCP connections on port 80, it’s
generally expected to speak
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>. That one
is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1340">actually codified in an RFC</a>, but
again, there’s nothing preventing you from, you know, just not.</p>

<p data-bo="14229">The rule is not <em>enforced</em>. Thankfully, there is no IETF police.</p>

<p data-bo="14295">And as you gain customers, and your product is used by a wider variety of
folks, you tend to encounter more and more folks that “just” completely
disregard your assumptions.</p>

<p data-bo="14470">Let’s take one of my favorite examples and look at the SSH protocol: when
a client connects to an SSH server, one of the first thing that happens is
that the server sends its version to the client.</p>

<p data-bo="14669">{% sc amossays %}
Why that part of the protocol exists, it’s hard to say. Presumably, the
authors of SSH were eager to give potential attackers an easier way to test
for vulnerabilities simply by parsing the version string, as is the case
of the <code>Server</code> HTTP header.</p>

<p data-bo="14938">Or maybe they didn’t think of it that way. It’s impossible to tell.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="15019">But wait, I lied! <em>Before</em> the servers sends its version, it may send
“other lines of data”.</p>

<p data-bo="15113">Now, normally-behaved SSH servers usually send lines from a text file, and we
call this their “banner message”. Or it can be automatically generated, and
then we call this a MOTD (for Message Of The Day).</p>

<p data-bo="15319">But if you think outside the box… and you want to prevent attackers from
getting inside the box…</p>

<p data-bo="15421">you can send…</p>

<p data-bo="15438">“lines of data”…</p>

<p data-bo="15458">very slowly…</p>

<p data-bo="15474">forever.</p>

<p data-bo="15484">This is called an <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/03/22/">SSH Tarpit</a>, and
I think it’s equal parts hilarious and brilliant.</p>

<p data-bo="15613">It’s also a clear violation of the implicit contract between an SSH client
and an SSH server. It’s not the <em>only</em> violation that can occur. For example,
the SSH server could just take a <em>very long</em> time to accept the connection
(ie. to complete the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake">TCP handshake</a>).</p>

<p data-bo="15946">But this violation is so common, it has <del>become a meme</del> caused all clients
to protect against it by default. Network applications tend to set “timeouts”
on operations - in this case, the “connect timeout” would expire, and the
client would simply give up, which would free it up to try again.</p>

<p data-bo="16242">If the SSH server simply sent <em>nothing</em>, a “read timeout” might expire, and
again, the client would give up on this connection and try again.</p>

<p data-bo="16385">In all four of the RFCs in which the SSH protocol is documented, the word
“timeout” is only mentioned once, to recommend that servers have an
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252#section-4">authentication timeout</a>.
There’s no mention of connection timeouts, a testament to the fact that
it’s just “one of these things you should know about if you program networked
applications”.</p>

<p data-bo="16766">Unfortunately, not all of “those things” are obvious, or even particularly
well-known.</p>

<p data-bo="16854">{% sc recap %}
If I say “you can’t talk to me like that”, well, there’s nothing preventing
you from continuing to talk to me like that. It’s rude, but not impossible.</p>

<code>ducks.example.org</code>, and <code>giraffes.example.org</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="17276">The problem? You really <em>only</em> want to serve <code>ducks.example.org</code> and

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=25144>function isRestricted(req) {
  return req.headers.Host === &quot;internal.example.org&quot;;
}
</code><p data-bo="25248">We can now change the condition in <code>handleRequest</code> to:</p>

</code><p data-bo="29302">So, the last missing piece of the puzzle is for the node.js “access control
proxy” to forward the request to the origin - and to forward the response
back to the client.</p>

<p data-bo="29473">And here’s one way we could do it:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=29509>async function proxyRequest(sock, payload) {
  let originSock = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    let sock = new net.Socket();

    });
  });
  originSock.write(payload);
  originSock.end();

  forward: while (true) {
    try {
      await readable(originSock);
    } catch (err) {
      break forward;
    }
    let buf = originSock.read();
    if (buf) {
      sock.write(buf);
    }
  }
  sock.end();
}
</code><p data-bo="30039">Which would seamlessly integrate with our existing server code, albeit
with the conditions flipped:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=30140>async function handleRequest(sock, payload) {
  let req = parseRequest(payload);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(req, null, 2));

  let { address } = sock.address();

  if (isRestricted(req) &amp;&amp; !isAllowed(address)) {
    let status = &quot;403 Forbidden&quot;;
    let output = &quot;Forbidden.&quot;;

    console.log(`[${address}] ${status}`);
    sock.write(`HTTP&#x2F;1.1 ${status}\r\n\r\n`);
    sock.write(`${output}\n`);
    sock.end();
    return;
  }

  await proxyRequest(sock, payload);
}
</code><p data-bo="30631">And with that, doing requests to localhost (ie. from <code>127.0.0.1</code>) gives us
access to everything from the origin:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=30745>$ for subdomain in ducks giraffes internal; do domain=&quot;${subdomain}.example.org&quot;; echo &quot;\n${domain}&quot;; curl --connect-to &quot;${domain}:80:127.0.0.1:8124&quot; &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;${domain}&quot; ; done

</code><p data-bo="31514">And there you have it. Our server infrastructure is feature complete. It does
serve all three sites, and in terms of access control, it even passes our
black-box test, where we use an external HTTP client to make a request and
only rely on the output.</p>

<p data-bo="31767">Our solution however, has several flaws which are, as we’re about to see,
quite problematic.</p>

<a id="http-is-only-as-real-as-you-want-it-to-be" href="#http-is-only-as-real-as-you-want-it-to-be" class="anchor"><h2>HTTP is only as real as you want it to be</h2></a>
<p data-bo="31907">curl is a well-behaved citizen of the HTTP-verse.</p>

<p data-bo="31958">By default, it sets the <code>Host</code> header to whatever was in the URL:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=32025>$ curl -v http:&#x2F;&#x2F;172.31.207.114:8124

</code><p data-bo="32448">And if you use the <code>-H</code> (or <code>--header</code>) flag to specify the <code>Host</code> header,
well, it replace it with that value:</p>

* no chunk, no close, no size. Assume close to signal end
&lt;

* Closing connection 0
</code><p data-bo="32987">If we use a different casing for the <code>Host</code> header, it normalizes it:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=33058>$ curl -v http:&#x2F;&#x2F;172.31.207.114:8124 -H &quot;hoST: ducks.example.org&quot;

</code><p data-bo="33484">And if we try to pass a <em>second</em> <code>Host</code> header (even with a different

</code><p data-bo="36409">The crux of the problem seems to be that they don’t agree what the <code>Host</code>
should be.</p>

<p data-bo="36495">The node.js service parses <em>all</em> headers, and stores them in a JS object,
which for non-JS folks, is more or less a hashmap, except it’s highly
optimized when there’s a small number of keys (at least in V8 - I’m not sure
what happens elsewhere).</p>

<p data-bo="36742">So when we parse this request:</p>

<code data-lang="raw" data-bo=36774>GET &#x2F; HTTP&#x2F;1.1
Host: internal.example.org
Host: ducks.example.org
User-Agent: netcat&#x2F;0.7.1
</code><p data-bo="36877">Our object first looks like this:</p>

<code data-lang="json" data-bo=36912>{
  &quot;Host&quot;: &quot;internal.example.org&quot;
}
</code><p data-bo="36962">And on the next line, it turns into this: <code>Host</code> is overwritten:</p>

<code data-lang="json" data-bo=37028>{
  &quot;Host&quot;: &quot;ducks.example.org&quot;
}
</code><p data-bo="37075">So, the node.js service <em>thinks</em> we’re requesting <code>ducks.example.org</code> and says:
door’s open, come on in!</p>

<p data-bo="37181">Our Go service, on the other hand, stops on the first <code>Host: </code> header line it finds:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=37267>    for {
      lineBytes, _, err := buf.ReadLine()
      line := strings.ToLower(string(lineBytes))
      log.Printf(&quot;%v&quot;, line)

      if strings.HasPrefix(line, hostPrefix) {
        host := strings.TrimPrefix(line, hostPrefix)
        &#x2F;&#x2F; omitted: host handling goes here
        continue handleConn
      }
      must(err)
    }
</code><p data-bo="37611">So, the first <code>Host</code> line has <code>internal.example.org</code>, and that’s what it
serves, not performing any further checks, since that’s not its job!</p>

<p data-bo="37754">But we can make an even <em>shorter</em> evil request.</p>

<code data-lang="raw" data-bo=37803>GET &#x2F; HTTP&#x2F;1.1
host: internal.example.org
User-Agent: netcat&#x2F;0.7.1

Right! Since the node.js service looks up the Host header in a case-sensitive
way, by doing <code>headers[&quot;Host&quot;]</code>, it just gets <code>undefined</code>, because here the
Host header is, in fact, lowercase.

<p data-bo="38629">And this is a good place to preempt some criticism: some of you may have paid

you, I say: well done!</p>

<p data-bo="38808">Code review skills are important. And if you did, you may have seen this

<p data-bo="39604">That, to me, is the real prize. But we’ll come back to that.</p>

<p data-bo="39666">Let’s start with Go. If we rewrite our origin server with Go, it might look a
little something like this:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=39773>package main

  }
}
</code><p data-bo="40579">There’s a lot of implicit behavior happening here. For example, if we look
up the documentation for <code>http.ResponseWriter.Write</code>, we learn the following:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="40735">Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="40802">So far so good.</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="40821">If WriteHeader has not yet been called, Write calls
<code>WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)</code> before writing the data.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="40930">I guess that <em>is</em> the happy path.</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="40967">If the Header does not contain a <code>Content-Type</code> line, <code>Write</code> adds a
<code>Content-Type</code> set to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written
data to <code>DetectContentType</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="41147">That’s… opinionated.</p>

<p data-bo="41171">Let’s take a quick look at <code>DetectContentType</code>:</p>

&#x2F;&#x2F; first 512 bytes of data. DetectContentType always returns
&#x2F;&#x2F; a valid MIME type: if it cannot determine a more specific one, it
&#x2F;&#x2F; returns &quot;application&#x2F;octet-stream&quot;.
func DetectContentType(data []byte) string {
  if len(data) &gt; sniffLen {
    data = data[:sniffLen]

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Index of the first non-whitespace byte in data.

</code><p data-bo="46730">Well. <em>At least it’s standard!</em></p>

<p data-bo="46763">Except if we <a href="https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/">look at the standard</a>, we learn
what it’s for:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="46863">The HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header field is intended to indicate the MIME type of
an HTTP response. However, many HTTP servers supply a <code>Content-Type</code> header
field value that does not match the actual contents of the response.
Historically, web browsers have tolerated these servers by examining the
content of HTTP responses in addition to the <code>Content-Type</code> header field in
order to determine the effective MIME type of the response.</p>

<p data-bo="47309">Without a clear specification for how to “sniff” the MIME type, each user
agent has been forced to reverse-engineer the algorithms of other user agents
in order to maintain interoperability. Inevitably, these efforts have not
been entirely successful, resulting in divergent behaviors among user agents.
In some cases, these divergent behaviors have had security implications, as a
user agent could interpret an HTTP response as a different MIME type than the
server intended.</p>

<p data-bo="47802">These security issues are most severe when an “honest” server allows
potentially malicious users to upload their own files and then serves the
contents of those files with a low-privilege MIME type. For example, if a
server believes that the client will treat a contributed file as an image
(and thus treat it as benign), but a user agent believes the content to be
HTML (and thus privileged to execute any scripts contained therein), an
attacker might be able to steal the user’s authentication credentials and
mount other cross-site scripting attacks. (Malicious servers, of course, can
specify an arbitrary MIME type in the <code>Content-Type</code> header field.)</p>

<p data-bo="48479">This document describes a content sniffing algorithm that carefully balances
the compatibility needs of user agent with the security constraints imposed
by existing web content. The algorithm originated from research conducted by
Adam Barth, Juan Caballero, and Dawn Song, based on content sniffing
algorithms present in popular user agents, an extensive database of existing
web content, and metrics collected from implementations deployed to a sizable
number of users.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="48963">A surprisingly readable introduction, for a standard. My understanding is that
this is a standard for user agents to follow, ie., HTTP clients. Why is an HTTP
server implementing this?</p>

<p data-bo="49149">Well, because Go is opinionated, of course! This saves us one entire line of
code! Conciseness, yay! <a href="https://ideolalia.com/essays/thought-leaders-and-chicken-sexers.html">Mr Graham would be so
proud</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="49352">Unfortunately, this means that, much like everything in Go, simple cases
“usually work”, until they don’t anymore, and then you better strap in
because you’re in for a <a href="/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">wild
ride</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="49577">What if you need to support a mime type that’s not in <code>sniffSignatures</code>?
Is that system extensible? Of course not!</p>

<p data-bo="49693"><code>sniffSignatures</code> is private (“unexported”, to be technical), so you can’t
add anything to it. It’s also a global, so it wouldn’t be wise to, anyway.</p>

<p data-bo="49844">In that case, you should probably have your <em>own</em> mechanism to tag assets
with their proper <code>Content-Type</code>, and set it explicitly, and at this point,
you’re paying for the whole “automatic buffering” for no added benefit.</p>

<p data-bo="50067">{% sc bearsays %}
It’s worth noting that the detection itself is <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/9c91cab0da9814a598f2c4f7568b6276ff972672/src/net/http/server.go#L1404">skipped in that case</a>.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="50274">That’s not the last bit of implicitness going on. The last paragraph for
<code>http.ResponseWriter.Write</code> reads:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="50385">Additionally, if the total size of all written data is under a few KB and
there are no <code>Flush</code> calls, the <code>Content-Length</code> header is added automatically.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="50542">If we read between the lines, that means an <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> has an
internal buffer, of “some size that’s less than a few kilobytes”, which it
uses to sniff the content-type.</p>

<p data-bo="50723">Well - actually that’s not true. An <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> does not have any
internal buffer, because it’s an <code>interface</code>! Only the implementation given
to you by the <code>http</code> package has a buffer. One could totally implement
<code>http.ResponseWriter</code> for another type that has completely different
semantics, and then the comments would be completely wrong.</p>

<p data-bo="51076"><em>Unless</em> you decide the interface’s comments are part of the interface
itself, and then you have, you guessed it - an implicit contract.</p>

<p data-bo="51214">Which nothing enforces.</p>

<p data-bo="51239">And then we find ourselves in the interesting position where this code is
unsafe:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=51322>func doSomething(rw http.ResponseWriter) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; 🙅‍♀️ woops, we&#x27;re casting to a completely different type
  writeStuff(rw)
}

func writeStuff(w io.Writer) {
  w.Write([]byte(&quot;stuff&quot;))
}
</code><p data-bo="51527">The comments for the <code>Write</code> method of <code>io.Write</code> do not mention any
content-type sniffing, buffering, or implicit header-writing:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="51661">Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.</p>

<p data-bo="51724">Write writes <code>len(p)</code> bytes from <code>p</code> to the underlying data stream. It returns
the number of bytes written from <code>p</code> (<code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= len(p)</code>) and any error
encountered that caused the write to stop early. Write must return a non-nil
error if it returns <code>n &lt; len(p)</code>. Write must not modify the slice data, even
temporarily.</p>

<p data-bo="52054">Implementations must not retain <code>p</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="52092">But hey, whatever. It works most of the time. And indeed if we do try
the new version of our origin server, it appears to work fine:</p>

<p data-bo="52602">Now onto node.js.</p>

<p data-bo="52621">It too, has an <code>http</code> package. Heck, it even has an <code>https</code> package! And an
<code>http2</code> package! Which makes it rather annoying to support all of these! But
not to worry - there’s numerous takes on this available today from your local

<p data-bo="52867">Instead of creating a <code>net.Server</code>, we now create an <code>http.Server</code>:</p>

async function main() {
  let server = new http.Server({});
  server.on(&quot;request&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=53419>async function handleRequest(req, res) {
  console.log(
    `[${req.socket.address().address}] ${JSON.stringify(req.headers, null, 2)}`,

    res.statusCode = 403;
    res.end(&quot;Forbidden.\n&quot;);
    return;
  }

  await proxyRequest(req, res);
}
</code><p data-bo="53750">The <code>isAllowed</code> and <code>isRestricted</code> methods are just as before:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=53814>function isAllowed(addr) {
  return addr.startsWith(&quot;127.0.0.&quot;) || addr.startsWith(&quot;2.58.12.&quot;);
}

function isRestricted(req) {
  return req.headers.Host === &quot;internal.example.org&quot;;
}
</code><p data-bo="54017">And finally, <code>proxyRequest</code> does a bunch of field-copying and piping:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=54088>async function proxyRequest(req, res) {
  let originReq = new http.ClientRequest(`http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.00.1:8125${req.url}`);

<p data-bo="59169">{% sc bearsays %}
Does it say what happens if you specify some headers multiple times?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="59269">{% sc amossays %}
As a matter of fact, it does:
{% endsc %}</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="59332">Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name:</p>

<p data-bo="59961">{% sc bearsays %}
Whew. That’s not a regular object at all.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60034">{% sc amossays %}
It does seem to do a fair amount of transformation.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60117">Note that this logic <em>would</em> clarify how our first “evil request” should be
handled. Only the first <code>Host</code> header counts, the other one is discarded.</p>

<p data-bo="60268">{% sc bearsays %}
Just out of curiosity, what’s the type of <code>ClientRequest.headers</code>?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60366">{% sc amossays %}
Well, let’s see… ah.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60420">{% sc bearsays %}
What?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60457">{% sc amossays %}
There’s no <code>ClientRequest.headers</code> field.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60530">{% sc bearsays %}
There’s none? Well how come we can assign to it?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="60610">Well bear, we can assign to it because this is JavaScript, and “fields” on
“objects” are a social construct. The only truth is hashmap (or hash table,
or dictionary, or associative array, or whatever you want to call it).</p>

<p data-bo="60833"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> could save us from that one,
and that’s why I swear by it.</p>

<p data-bo="60939">So, let’s take a look at how we’re actually supposed to set headers.</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="61011">The header is still mutable using the <code>setHeader(name, value)</code>,
<code>getHeader(name)</code>, <code>removeHeader(name)</code></p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="61118">Interesting! So we have to <em>iterate</em> through all the headers from our
incoming request, and set them one by one on the outgoing request.</p>

<p data-bo="61256">Something like that:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=61278>for (const k of Object.keys(req.headers)) {
  originReq.setHeader(k, req.headers[k]);
}
</code><p data-bo="61385">With that change, things appear to work:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=61427>$ curl --raw -i http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ducks.example.org --connect-to ducks.example.org:80:localhost:8124

</code><p data-bo="61685">Unfortunately, it’s still using <code>transfer-encoding: chunked</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="61748">{% sc bearsays %}
Also, what about multiple headers?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="61814">{% sc amossays %}
How do you mean?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="61862">{% sc bearsays %}
Sure, it’s not meaningful to have more than one <code>Host</code>, unless you’re trying
some funny business. But for some <em>other</em> headers, it makes perfect sense.</p>

<p data-bo="62093">Alrighty, let’s make a request with two <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers - which is how
you set multiple cookies. It can’t be concatenated with <code>;</code>, or <code>,</code>, because

<p data-bo="69091">{% sc amossays %}

<p data-bo="69262">{% sc bearsays %}

<p data-bo="69564">{% sc bearsays %}
Don’t deflect - what’s wrong with reading docs?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="69643">Well, we’ve been over this with Go before.</p>

<p data-bo="69687">Every time you rely on documentation to enforce correct behavior, you’re
exposing the users of your API to potential bugs. Your API is no longer
misuse-resistant.</p>

<p data-bo="69851">And you don’t need a fancy type checker to do it, either.</p>

<p data-bo="69910">If the <code>ClientRequest</code> or <code>ServerResponse</code> objects were
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal">sealed</a>,
and we were using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict
mode</a>,
a <code>TypeError</code> could have been thrown when we tried to assign to <code>res.headers</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="70262">Of course if you <em>do</em> have a fancy type checker, you could catch that error
<em>before it happens</em>, which as far as I’m concerned, is the absolute dream.</p>

<p data-bo="70414">{% sc bearsays %}
So that’s a “yes” on the lazy thing?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="70482">Not quite - I wouldn’t say I’m “lazy”, but I am a “realist”.</p>

<p data-bo="70544">{% sc bearsays %}
Oh boy, there he goes.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="70598"><em>Ideally</em>,
everyone reads all the docs all the time, including whenever upgrading
dependencies, and nobody ever breaks <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic
versioning</a>, and we’re all smart enough to write C code
that isn’t <a href="/articles/working-with-strings-in-rust">a trash fire waiting to
happen</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="70890">But <em>in actuality</em>, semver breakage happens all the dang time, we’re all
exhausted and occasionally tell dependabot to just “rebase and push” at the
end of a long workday, and the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">CVE database</a> is not
going out of business any time soon.</p>

<p data-bo="71154">From what we’ve seen so far, here are some of the things we could do in
node.js, that would look <em>totally normal and innocent</em> in code review, but
are actually way broken:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Assign to <code>request.headers</code> or <code>response.headers</code> - those fields don’t
exist</li>
<li>Call <code>request.setHeader(&quot;set-cookie&quot;, &quot;a=b&quot;)</code>, then call
<code>request.setHeader(&quot;set-cookie&quot;, &quot;c=d&quot;)</code> (the second value would overwrite
the first one)</li>
<li>Treat <code>message.headers[&quot;some-key&quot;]</code> like a string (not true for <code>set-cookie</code>)</li>
<li>Try to forward all headers by using <code>response.setHeader</code> on all the key-value
pairs from a request.</li>
</ol>
<p data-bo="71754">{% sc bearsays %}
Wait, how is that last one wrong?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="71819">I’m so glad you asked! You see, node.js <em>does</em> quite a bit of transformation before
populating, say, <code>message.headers</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="71940">So if there <em>were</em> multiples of a header it didn’t know about, it would join them
together with <code>,</code>. But what if that’s not what you wanted?</p>

<p data-bo="72082">If you’re writing a proxy, you may want to forward the headers more or less
untouched, minus maybe some headers that are protected&#x2F;sensitive, and maybe
adding one or two headers which are internal.</p>

<p data-bo="72281">{% sc bearsays %}
Can’t you do that in node.js?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="72342">You <strong>totally can</strong> do that in node.js, thanks to <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/http.html#http_message_rawheaders">rawHeaders</a>:</p>

<blockquote><a id="message-rawheaders" href="#message-rawheaders" class="anchor"><h3><code>message.rawHeaders</code></h3></a>

<ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type">&lt;string[]&gt;</a></li>
</ul>
<p data-bo="72642">The raw request&#x2F;response headers list exactly as they were received.</p>

<p data-bo="72715">The keys and values are in the same list. It is <em>not</em> a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values.</p>

<p data-bo="72895">Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged.</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=72963>&#x2F;&#x2F; Prints something like:
&#x2F;&#x2F;
&#x2F;&#x2F; [ &#x27;user-agent&#x27;,

&#x2F;&#x2F;   &#x27;*&#x2F;*&#x27; ]
console.log(request.rawHeaders);
</code></blockquote>
<p data-bo="73244">So technically, all we need to do is this:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=73288>for (let i = 0; i &lt; req.rawHeaders.length; i += 2) {
  let k = req.rawHeaders[i];
  let v = req.rawHeaders[i + 1];
  originReq.setHeader(k, v);
}
</code><p data-bo="73453">And everything should work out</p>

<p data-bo="73485">Let’s use <code>netcat</code> as a listener again:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=73526>$ curl --raw -i http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ducks.example.org --connect-to ducks.example.org:80:localhost:8124 -H &quot;Set-Cookie: one=1&quot; -H &quot;Set-Cookie: two=2&quot;

User-Agent: curl&#x2F;7.73.0
Accept: *&#x2F;*
Set-Cookie: two=2
Connection: close
</code><p data-bo="73894">Wait, where did <code>one=1</code> go?</p>

<p data-bo="73923">{% sc bearsays %}
Uhhh if you call <code>setHeader</code> with the same name twice, it overwrites…
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="74026">Oh right! Haha. That’s number 2 on the list. We were warned, and we stepped
right in it anyway.</p>

<p data-bo="74123">So what’s the correct way do to it? Well… there’s no method of
<code>ClientRequest</code> that lets us pass “raw headers”, unlike <code>ServerResponse</code>,
which has <code>writeHead</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="74286">Sure, we could do something like this:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=74326>&#x2F;&#x2F; First, collect all raw headers into a Map&lt;String, Array&lt;String&gt;&gt;
let headers = {};
for (let i = 0; i &lt; req.rawHeaders.length; i += 2) {
  let k = req.rawHeaders[i];
  let v = req.rawHeaders[i + 1];
  headers[k] = [...(headers[k] || []), v];
}
for (const k of Object.keys(headers)) {
  let vv = headers[k];
  &#x2F;&#x2F; `vv` is a non-string, so node.js should &quot;leave them alone&quot;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; and only &quot;transform them to strings&quot; when sending them over
  &#x2F;&#x2F; the network.
  originReq.setHeader(k, vv);
}
</code><p data-bo="74833">This <em>would</em> let our two <code>Set-Cookie</code> lines pass:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=74884>$ nc -vvv -l localhost -p 8125
Listening on any address 8125
Connection from 127.0.0.1:47522
GET &#x2F; HTTP&#x2F;1.1
Host: ducks.example.org
User-Agent: curl&#x2F;7.73.0
Accept: *&#x2F;*
Set-Cookie: one=1
Set-Cookie: two=2
Connection: close
</code><p data-bo="75120">Unless one of them had a slightly different casing…</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=75175>$ curl --raw -i http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ducks.example.org --connect-to ducks.example.org:80:localhost:8124 -H &quot;Set-Cookie: one=1&quot; -H &quot;set-Cookie: two=2&quot;
</code><p data-bo="75325">(The second is <code>set-Cookie</code>, with a lowercase <code>s</code>)</p>

<p data-bo="75377">…and then only one of them would pass:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=75419>$ nc -vvv -l localhost -p 8125
Listening on any address 8125
Connection from 127.0.0.1:47538

User-Agent: curl&#x2F;7.73.0
Accept: *&#x2F;*
set-Cookie: two=2
Connection: close
</code><p data-bo="75637">We could of course normalize the casing ourselves to all-lowercase - or
something else - but then we’re back to transforming headers and we’re not
being a very transparent proxy.</p>

<p data-bo="75817">As far as I’m concerned, I don’t see a way to make a node.js <code>ClientRequest</code>
send multiple headers, some of which only differ from the others by their
casing.</p>

<p data-bo="77323">So let’s not think about it.</p>

<p data-bo="77353">As it turns out, node.js normalizes header names to lower cases. We’ve read

<p data-bo="78674">So the documentation for <code>isAllowed</code> is… we didn’t write any.</p>

<p data-bo="78739">But <a href="">the documentation</a> for <code>request.socket.address()</code> is:</p>

<blockquote><a id="socket-address" href="#socket-address" class="anchor"><h3><code>socket.address()</code></h3></a>
<p data-bo="78830">Added in: v0.1.90</p>

<p data-bo="78970">Returns the bound <code>address</code>, the address <code>family</code> name and <code>port</code> of the socket as reported by the operating system: <code>{ port: 12346, family: &#x27;IPv4&#x27;, address: &#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27; }</code></p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="79150">Which returns… an <code>Object</code>, so far so good, with fields <code>port</code>, <code>family</code>,
and <code>address</code>. Ah, there it is! What we want is
<code>request.socket.address().address</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="79311">It somehow got lost in the port (no pun intended). And this time I <em>swear</em> I
didn’t do a mistake on purpose, just to illustrate this article.</p>

<p data-bo="79454">{% sc bearsays %}
Yeah right.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="79497">While we’re fixing this bug, let’s do a pass over the whole code. We’ll give
up on proxying the headers as-is. Apparently that’s just not something the
node.js <code>http</code> package is meant for - which is fine! Not everything needs to
be general-purpose.</p>

<p data-bo="79747">So let’s just use <code>setHeader</code> for the <code>ClientRequest</code>, and let’s use <code>writeHead</code>
for the <code>ServerResponse</code>, which is the closest we can reasonably get today.</p>

<p data-bo="79905">{% sc tip %}
Note that <code>writeHead</code> accepts <em>either</em> raw headers or normalized headers,
which means it must be able to distinguish between an “object” (or hash map,
or hash table, or dictionary, or associative array) and an “array”.</p>

<p data-bo="80138">I wonder what it does when you pass an array with an odd number of fields. So
much delicious undefined behavior! But there’s only so much that’s fit to print.
You try it and <a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime">report back</a>!

<p data-bo="80376">So, without further ado, here’s the final version of our node.js code:</p>

  let port = 8124;
  server.listen(port, &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(`Now listening on port ${port}`);
  });
})();

&#x2F;&#x2F; none of what we were doing was async, so it&#x27;s all
&#x2F;&#x2F; old-style node.js callbacks now
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  console.log(
    `[${req.socket.address().address}] ${JSON.stringify(req.headers, null, 2)}`,
  );

  if (isRestricted(req) &amp;&amp; !isAllowed(req.socket.address().address)) {

<p data-bo="83401">First off, it’s unhappy about our <code>handleRequest</code> function:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="83464">Parameter <code>req</code> implicitly has an <code>any</code> type, but a better type may be inferred from usage.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="83557">Actually inferring it from usage results in a pretty lengthy type, based on,
well, usage - so after it does that, there’s no longer any errors, but it also
doesn’t match the node.js API, just “how we use it”:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=83767>&#x2F;**
 * @param {{ socket: { address: () =&gt; { (): any; new (): any; address: any; }; }; headers: { [x: string]: string | number | readonly string[]; }; url: any; pipe: (arg0: import(&quot;http&quot;).ClientRequest) =&gt; void; }} req
 * @param {{ statusCode: number; end: (arg0: string) =&gt; void; writeHead: (arg0: number, arg1: string, arg2: string[]) =&gt; void; }} res
 *&#x2F;
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; etc.
}
</code><p data-bo="84190">Instead, what we want is this:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=84222>&#x2F;**
 * @param {http.IncomingMessage} req
 * @param {http.ServerResponse} res
 *&#x2F;
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; etc.
}
</code><p data-bo="84369">And if we do this, it finds two errors!</p>

</code><p data-bo="85034">Well. That’s rather unhelpful. I <em>can</em> see a <code>net.Socket</code> returning an empty
object (although, why not <code>null</code>?) if we call <code>address()</code> before it’s connected,
like so:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=85202>$ node -i
Welcome to Node.js v15.3.0.
Type &quot;.help&quot; for more information.
&gt; let sock = new require(&quot;net&quot;).Socket();
undefined
&gt; sock.address()
{}
&gt;
</code><p data-bo="85363">…but in this case, that can never happen: <code>handleRequest</code> is only ever
passed to <code>server.on(&quot;request&quot;, ...)</code>, and so it only ever gets instances of
<code>http.IncomingMessage</code>, whose <code>socket</code>s are <em>always</em> connected, so
<code>address()</code> never returns <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="85613">So, that’s a false positive: the type checker is reporting an error where
there is none. I can see that it’s just trying to be cautious - things may be
fine now, but what if we called <code>handleRequest</code> for somewhere else, with a
carefully-crafted <code>http.IncomingMessage</code> whose <code>socket</code> was <em>not</em> connected?</p>

<p data-bo="85918">Then who would be the wiser? tsc, no doubt.</p>

<p data-bo="85963">But in the meantime, let’s use the escape hatch TypeScript gives us and just
add a <code>!</code> after accessing the field:</p>

47       originRes.statusCode,

</code><p data-bo="93066">That one’s a bit annoying. If the server does not respond with a status code,
well… wouldn’t parsing fail way before then? We wouldn’t even get headers!</p>

<p data-bo="93222">But sure, let’s be “correct”:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=93253>originReq.on(&quot;response&quot;, (originRes) =&gt; {
  if (!originRes.statusCode) {
    res.writeHead(502, &quot;Oh hey y&#x27;all are back early&quot;);
    res.end(&quot;Origin&#x27;s haunted.&quot;);
    return;
  }

  &#x2F;&#x2F; forward origin response headers to client
  res.writeHead(
    originRes.statusCode,
    originRes.statusMessage,
    originRes.rawHeaders,
  );
  &#x2F;&#x2F; forward origin response body to client
  originRes.pipe(res);
});
</code><p data-bo="93672">Amazingly, this is enough for <code>tsc</code> to figure out that if we reach the second
<code>res.writeHead</code>, then <code>originRes.statusCode</code> <em>cannot be falsy</em>, so this took
care of that error.</p>

<p data-bo="93848">(This is not sarcastic btw, I genuinely like TypeScript a lot. It’s the best
of a very messy situation).</p>

<p data-bo="93954">Finally, we’re left with this error:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=93992>$ index.js:39:28 - error TS2345: Argument of type &#x27;string | string[] | undefined&#x27; is not assignable to parameter of type &#x27;string | number | readonly string[]&#x27;.
  Type &#x27;undefined&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;string | number | readonly string[]&#x27;.

39     originReq.setHeader(k, req.headers[k]);
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</code><p data-bo="94343">That one’s annoying - but illuminating. Much easier than reading the docs.</p>

<p data-bo="94419">{% sc bearsays %}
Okay I’m halfway onboard the lazy train now - this <em>is</em> nicer than opening
the docs. You can even keep your browser closed.</p>

<p data-bo="94562">I could get used to this.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="94601">So, according to the types we’re seeing here, <code>requests[k]</code> <em>could</em> be <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="94686">I’m not sure I agree, but maybe it’s confused by our usage of <code>Object.keys</code>?</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=94764>for (const k of Object.keys(req.headers)) {
  originReq.setHeader(k, req.headers[k]);
}
</code><p data-bo="94871">If I hover the <code>k</code> in <code>const k</code>, it just says <code>string</code>, which - okay, yeah, if we
look up <em>arbitrary</em> header names, we might get <code>undefined</code>. Otherwise, we won’t.</p>

<p data-bo="95035">We can fix it like this:</p>

<code data-lang="javascript" data-bo=95061>&#x2F;&#x2F; forward client request headers to origin
for (const k of Object.keys(req.headers)) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; this is solely to make the type checker happy
  let v = req.headers[k];
  if (v) {
    originReq.setHeader(k, v);
  }
}
</code><p data-bo="95293">Which is… not great, because we’re adding an <code>if</code> branch solely for
type-checking purposes, and I don’t think it’ll be eliminated. It might be
deemed “unlikely” by the JIT and the “it’s never undefined” path may become
the fast path, but that’s for me to ignore and you to profile.</p>

<p data-bo="95578">The other option is to use <code>&#x2F;&#x2F;@ts-ignore</code>, but it’s a bit too much of a
shotgun blast for my taste, since it disables checking for the <em>whole line</em>.
What if that line was doing something else wrong? Uncaught errors! The
horror!</p>

<p data-bo="95807">{% sc recap %}
TypeScript can help catch <em>some</em> misuses of the node.js APIs, but not all of them!</p>

<p data-bo="95906">Sometimes, it <em>thinks</em> it’s caught errors, but really, it’s only just getting
in the way.</p>

<p data-bo="95997">This is not really TypeScript’s fault. Typings for a package can only be as
good as the original package. If a function returns <code>string | number | readonly string[]</code>, well, all bets are off.

<a id="just-gopher-it" href="#just-gopher-it" class="anchor"><h2>Just gopher it</h2></a>
<p data-bo="96220">It is time… to look at Go again. If anything, we’ve learn that accurately
modelling HTTP, even just HTTP headers, is harder than it appears at first
glance.</p>

<p data-bo="96380">Do you remember, ages ago, when someone confidently said that?</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="96446">HTTP&#x2F;1.1 seems like a pretty simple protocol…</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="96495">How foolish it seems now! Utter hogwash.</p>

<p data-bo="96537">Sometimes things are just complicated!</p>

<p data-bo="96577">And it’s not like you can convince everyone to speak a particular flavor of
HTTP; those services are meant to be user-facing, handling requests from a
variety of user agents, some of which are malicious, while the rest are
merely misguided (which is programmer for “opinionated, but in a way that’s
not to my advantage”).</p>

<p data-bo="96900">So, let’s take a look at how Go tackles this problem. But be warned: I’m
going to say nice things about it.</p>

<p data-bo="97009">{% sc bearsays %}
Whaaaaaaaat? But that goes against the preconceived notion that so many people
have of you, you can’t just-
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="97148">{% sc amossays %}
Hate to interrupt you bear, but I think we’ve blown past our quota for “meta
banter” several pages ago, we better get on with it.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="97309">So, we’ve looked at some of the types that node.js uses to represent headers,
and so far we’ve had:</p>

<ul><li>An object, whose keys are always lower-case (unless you mess with it… but
plz refrain), and whose values are always strings, unless they’re arrays
of strings, which <code>set-cookie</code> always is, but others might be too,
according to the TypeScript typings.</li>
</ul>
<p data-bo="97672">And then:</p>

<ul><li>An array of length <code>n*2</code>, where even positions contain header names (that’s right,
<code>0</code> is even), and odd positions contain header values.</li>
</ul>
<p data-bo="97826"><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/http.html#http_message_rawheaders">The documentation</a> takes special care to note that:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="97958">The keys and values are in the same list. It is <strong>not</strong> a list of tuples.
So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets
are the associated values.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="98139">This sounds a little funky at first, until you realize that, well, JavaScript
does not have tuples, so it would have to be an array of arrays, and that
ends up being a <em>lot</em> of allocations, and even more importantly, a lot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">GC</a>
bookkeeping.</p>

<p data-bo="98455">So, enough with the suspense - what does Go do?</p>

<p data-bo="98504">Well first off, <code>Go</code> actually takes the <code>host</code> header and extracts it to a
separate field:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=98596>type Request struct {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; (other fields are omitted)

  &#x2F;&#x2F; For server requests, Host specifies the host on which the
  &#x2F;&#x2F; URL is sought. For HTTP&#x2F;1 (per RFC 7230, section 5.4), this
  &#x2F;&#x2F; is either the value of the &quot;Host&quot; header or the host name
  &#x2F;&#x2F; given in the URL itself. For HTTP&#x2F;2, it is the value of the
  &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;:authority&quot; pseudo-header field.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; It may be of the form &quot;host:port&quot;. For international domain
  &#x2F;&#x2F; names, Host may be in Punycode or Unicode form. Use
  &#x2F;&#x2F; golang.org&#x2F;x&#x2F;net&#x2F;idna to convert it to either format if
  &#x2F;&#x2F; needed.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, server Handlers should
  &#x2F;&#x2F; validate that the Host header has a value for which the
  &#x2F;&#x2F; Handler considers itself authoritative. The included
  &#x2F;&#x2F; ServeMux supports patterns registered to particular host
  &#x2F;&#x2F; names and thus protects its registered Handlers.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, Host optionally overrides the Host
  &#x2F;&#x2F; header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses
  &#x2F;&#x2F; the value of URL.Host. Host may contain an international
  &#x2F;&#x2F; domain name.
  Host string
}
</code><p data-bo="99673">What the comment omits is that, for HTTP&#x2F;1, only the <em>first</em> <code>Host</code> header is
taken into account - which sounds reasonable, and matches what node.js does.</p>

<p data-bo="99829">What the comment does point out, is that this struct also works for
HTTP&#x2F;2 - it simply jams the <code>:authority</code> pseudo-header in there (as per
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3">RFC 7540</a>).</p>

<p data-bo="100036">{% sc bearsays %}
…do you think linking RFCs will make commenters easier on you? Because
that’s not going to work.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="100166">{% sc amossays %}
Look,
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="100203">Similarly, <code>Content-Length</code> has its own field:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=100251>  &#x2F;&#x2F; ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; Values &gt;= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
  &#x2F;&#x2F; be read from Body.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, a value of 0 with a non-nil Body is
  &#x2F;&#x2F; also treated as unknown.
  ContentLength int64
</code><p data-bo="100587">There’s also fields for <code>TransferEncoding</code>, and <code>Connection: Close</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="100657">As for the other headers, well, there’s <code>Header</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=100708>  &#x2F;&#x2F; Header contains the request header fields either received
  &#x2F;&#x2F; by the server or to be sent by the client.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; If a server received a request with header lines,
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Host: example.com
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Accept-Language: en-us
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  fOO: Bar
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  foo: two
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; then
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Header = map[string][]string{
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: {&quot;gzip, deflate&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Accept-Language&quot;: {&quot;en-us&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Foo&quot;: {&quot;Bar&quot;, &quot;two&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  }
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For incoming requests, the Host header is promoted to the
  &#x2F;&#x2F; Request.Host field and removed from the Header map.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive. The
  &#x2F;&#x2F; request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey,
  &#x2F;&#x2F; making the first character and any characters following a
  &#x2F;&#x2F; hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, certain headers such as Content-Length
  &#x2F;&#x2F; and Connection are automatically written when needed and
  &#x2F;&#x2F; values in Header may be ignored. See the documentation
  &#x2F;&#x2F; for the Request.Write method.
  Header Header
</code><p data-bo="101803">There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s go paragraph by paragraph:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=101870>  &#x2F;&#x2F; Header contains the request header fields either received
  &#x2F;&#x2F; by the server or to be sent by the client.
</code><p data-bo="101992">Go uses the same types for sending and receiving requests, which is occasionally
convenient, and often a very large <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>
since some fields may only make sense when sending, and others while receiving.</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=102239>  &#x2F;&#x2F; If a server received a request with header lines,
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Host: example.com
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Accept-Language: en-us
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  fOO: Bar
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  foo: two
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; then
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  Header = map[string][]string{
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: {&quot;gzip, deflate&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Accept-Language&quot;: {&quot;en-us&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;    &quot;Foo&quot;: {&quot;Bar&quot;, &quot;two&quot;},
  &#x2F;&#x2F;  }
</code><p data-bo="102609">Here we can see the <em>actual</em> underlying type of <code>Header</code>: a <code>map[string][]string</code>. Or,
as we’ve spelled it before, in TypeScript parlance, a <code>Map&lt;String, Array&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="102781">{% sc bearsays %}
…which was not quite accurate, as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map">ES6
Map</a>
is not the same as an Object.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="102977">Basically, it means that for every header name, we have an array (well, a Go slice) of
potential values.</p>

<p data-bo="103083">Which leaves us with the problem of the header <em>names</em>, which should be case-insensitive.</p>

<p data-bo="103174">As we can see from the example, and unlike node.js, Go’s <code>http</code> package does
<em>not</em> just lower-case everything. It takes the surprising approach of…
making everything Title-Case:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=103355>  &#x2F;&#x2F; HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive. The
  &#x2F;&#x2F; request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey,
  &#x2F;&#x2F; making the first character and any characters following a
  &#x2F;&#x2F; hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
</code><p data-bo="103602">Here’s the actual implementation of <code>CanonicalHeaderKey</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=103661>&#x2F;&#x2F; CanonicalHeaderKey returns the canonical format of the
&#x2F;&#x2F; header key s. The canonicalization converts the first
&#x2F;&#x2F; letter and any letter following a hyphen to upper case;
&#x2F;&#x2F; the rest are converted to lowercase. For example, the
&#x2F;&#x2F; canonical key for &quot;accept-encoding&quot; is &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;.
&#x2F;&#x2F; If s contains a space or invalid header field bytes, it is
&#x2F;&#x2F; returned without modifications.
func CanonicalHeaderKey(s string) string { return textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey(s) }
</code><p data-bo="104149">…fine, here’s the actual implementation of <code>CanonicalMimeHeaderKey</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=104221>&#x2F;&#x2F; CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey returns the canonical format of the
&#x2F;&#x2F; MIME header key s. The canonicalization converts the first
&#x2F;&#x2F; letter and any letter following a hyphen to upper case;
&#x2F;&#x2F; the rest are converted to lowercase. For example, the
&#x2F;&#x2F; canonical key for &quot;accept-encoding&quot; is &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;.
&#x2F;&#x2F; MIME header keys are assumed to be ASCII only.
&#x2F;&#x2F; If s contains a space or invalid header field bytes, it is
&#x2F;&#x2F; returned without modifications.
func CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey(s string) string {
  commonHeaderOnce.Do(initCommonHeader)

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Quick check for canonical encoding.
  upper := true

      return s
    }
    if upper &amp;&amp; &#x27;a&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;z&#x27; {
      return canonicalMIMEHeaderKey([]byte(s))
    }
    if !upper &amp;&amp; &#x27;A&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;Z&#x27; {
      return canonicalMIMEHeaderKey([]byte(s))
    }
    upper = c == &#x27;-&#x27;
  }
  return s
}

Hey! That’s not utf-8 safe!
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="105208">{% sc amossays %}
Doesn’t matter. As per RFC 2616, header names are “tokens”, and a “token”
is “at least 1 of: any CHAR except CTLs or separators”, and a “CHAR” is
“any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)”.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="105428">This is actually only the checking code - the fast path. That’s right, <strong>Go
servers are slower if you send them lower-case headers</strong>. Maybe we shouldn’t
have written our access control service in node.js!</p>

<p data-bo="105634">Here’s where the actual mutation happens:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=105677>&#x2F;&#x2F; canonicalMIMEHeaderKey is like CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey but is
&#x2F;&#x2F; allowed to mutate the provided byte slice before returning the
&#x2F;&#x2F; string.
&#x2F;&#x2F;
&#x2F;&#x2F; For invalid inputs (if a contains spaces or non-token bytes), a
&#x2F;&#x2F; is unchanged and a string copy is returned.
func canonicalMIMEHeaderKey(a []byte) string {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; See if a looks like a header key. If not, return it unchanged.
  for _, c := range a {
    if validHeaderFieldByte(c) {
      continue
    }
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Don&#x27;t canonicalize.
    return string(a)
  }

  upper := true
  for i, c := range a {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Canonicalize: first letter upper case
    &#x2F;&#x2F; and upper case after each dash.
    &#x2F;&#x2F; (Host, User-Agent, If-Modified-Since).
    &#x2F;&#x2F; MIME headers are ASCII only, so no Unicode issues.
    if upper &amp;&amp; &#x27;a&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;z&#x27; {
      c -= toLower
    } else if !upper &amp;&amp; &#x27;A&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;Z&#x27; {
      c += toLower
    }
    a[i] = c
    upper = c == &#x27;-&#x27; &#x2F;&#x2F; for next time
  }
  &#x2F;&#x2F; The compiler recognizes m[string(byteSlice)] as a special
  &#x2F;&#x2F; case, so a copy of a&#x27;s bytes into a new string does not
  &#x2F;&#x2F; happen in this map lookup:
  if v := commonHeader[string(a)]; v != &quot;&quot; {
    return v
  }
  return string(a)
}
</code><p data-bo="106844">This code actually mentions that “MIME headers are ASCII only”. That’s genuinely nice.</p>

<p data-bo="106932">This part is not so nice:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=106959>  &#x2F;&#x2F; The compiler recognizes m[string(byteSlice)] as a special

  &#x2F;&#x2F; happen in this map lookup:
  if v := commonHeader[string(a)]; v != &quot;&quot; {
</code><p data-bo="107171">But I guess <a href="/articles/working-with-strings-in-rust">strings are hard</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="107244">So, in Go:</p>

<ul><li>Any header name can have any number of header values</li>
<li>All header names are normalized to <code>Weird-Pre-Http2-Case</code></li>
</ul>
<p data-bo="107372">And indeed, the <code>Header</code> type (which really should be called <code>HeaderMap</code>, or
<code>Headers</code> or something, but conciseness above all!!) comes with a collection
of handy methods.</p>

<p data-bo="107545">It has <code>Add(key, value string)</code>, it has <code>Clone()</code>, <code>Del(key string)</code>,
<code>Get(key string)</code>, <code>Set(key, value string)</code>, and <code>Values(key string) []string</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="107696">It also has <code>Write(w io.Writer) error</code> and <code>WriteSubset(w io.Writer, exclude map[string]bool) error</code> - the latter feels like a strange addition, but maybe
there’s a good reason for it.</p>

<p data-bo="107882">Here’s the thing though - <code>Header</code> is not a <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="107937">It’s just a type definition. (Not a type alias - those are different!).</p>

<p data-bo="108010">Here it is:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=108023>type Header map[string][]string
</code><p data-bo="108066">Which means that any function that can operate on a <code>map[k]v</code>, can also
operate on a <code>Header</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="108162">So… you could totally still have the same bug we had in node.js:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=108230>package main

import (
  &quot;log&quot;
  &quot;net&#x2F;http&quot;
)

func main() {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; This is constructed properly, according to the &quot;contract&quot; written
  &#x2F;&#x2F; in `http.Header`&#x27;s documentation:
  headers := http.Header{
    &quot;Host&quot;: []string{&quot;internal.example.org&quot;},
  }

  &#x2F;&#x2F; but it is parsed incorrectly:
  log.Printf(&quot;Is this endpoint restricted? %v&quot;, isRestricted(headers))
}

func isRestricted(headers http.Header) bool {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; nothing is preventing us from doing this
  for _, v := range headers[&quot;host&quot;] {
    if v == &quot;internal.example.org&quot; {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}
</code><p data-bo="108810">This prints:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=108824>2009&#x2F;11&#x2F;10 23:00:00 Is this endpoint restricted? false
</code><p data-bo="108893">Similarly, there’s nothing that prevents us from constructing an instance of <code>http.Header</code>
that contradicts its documentation:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=109021>package main

import (
  &quot;net&#x2F;http&quot;
  &quot;os&quot;

    &quot;host&quot;: []string{&quot;ducks.example.org&quot;},
  }

  headers.Write(os.Stdout)
}
</code><p data-bo="109241">Also, and this one is completely gratuitous, you can construct this, which makes no sense whatsoever:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=109344>package main

import (
  &quot;net&#x2F;http&quot;
  &quot;os&quot;
)

func main() {
  headers := http.Header{
    &quot;secure&quot;: []string{},
  }

  headers.Write(os.Stdout)
}
</code><p data-bo="109501">This just doesn’t write anything.</p>

<p data-bo="109536">But if someone were to check whether the key’s in the map…</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=109598>package main

}
</code><code data-lang="shell" data-bo=109849>2009&#x2F;11&#x2F;10 23:00:00 This request is secure!
</code><p data-bo="109907">And this all stems from one of the aspects of Go I’ve discussed before, which
is that the shortcuts that were taken when designing its type system makes it
a language that’s both very confusing (in lieu of being “simple”) <em>and</em> that
consistently resists modelling reality.</p>

<p data-bo="110181">A good example of this is zero values.</p>

<p data-bo="110221">Go fields <em>cannot</em> be uninitialized, because every type has a zero value.</p>

</code><p data-bo="112052">Such an API lets us do many things! We can insert a profile into the
database, then get it, update one field, and get it again:</p>

  }
  id := db.Insert(pf)

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Update the name

    pf.Name = &quot;Elizabeth&quot;
    db.Update(id, pf)
  }

  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, db.Get(id))
}
</code><p data-bo="112606">But what if we wanted to update a record <em>without</em> retrieving it?</p>

<p data-bo="112673">Something like this:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=112695>func main() {
  db := database.NewDB()

  db.Update(id, database.Profile{Name: &quot;Elizabeth&quot;})

  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, db.Get(id))
}
</code><p data-bo="113034">In terms of performance, this can make a big difference. We no longer have to
read and deserialize <em>all the fields</em> from the database only to put them back
again. Writes can be batched transparently so they can be executed very
rapidly, instead of constantly blocking because we’re waiting for reads to be
done.</p>

<p data-bo="113347">But with our current design, it does not work, because it resets
<code>Profile.Bio</code> to its zero value:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=113446>$ go run main.go
2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 22:18:41 database.Profile{Name:&quot;Elizabeth&quot;, Bio:&quot;&quot;}
</code><p data-bo="113540">So, when I say “Go fields cannot be uninitialized”, it doesn’t mean “the
compiler will make sure you initialize everything to some meaningful value”.
It means “if you don’t, the compiler will insert zero values, which may or
may not make sense for your application”.</p>

<p data-bo="113808">Of course, not all hope is lost - we can adjust our database implementation
to <em>only</em> update fields that have non-zero values set:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=113940>&#x2F;&#x2F; in `go-musings&#x2F;database&#x2F;database.go`

func (db *DB) Update(id int64, profile Profile) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; pretend this isn&#x27;t just a dumb `map[k]v` and
  &#x2F;&#x2F; we can actually update things in-place, otherwise
  &#x2F;&#x2F; none of this makes any sense.
  pf := db.records[id]
  changed := false
  if profile.Name != &quot;&quot; {
    pf.Name = profile.Name
    changed = true
  }
  if profile.Bio != &quot;&quot; {
    pf.Bio = profile.Bio
    changed = true
  }
  if changed {
    db.records[id] = pf
  }
}
</code><p data-bo="114418">Now our program actually works! We can update the <code>Name</code> while leaving the <code>Bio</code> alone.</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=114507>$ go run main.go

</code><p data-bo="114667">…but now there’s something we can no longer do. If we try to <em>just</em> clear the <code>Bio</code>:</p>

  db.Update(id, database.Profile{Bio: &quot;&quot;})

  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, db.Get(id))

</code><p data-bo="115242">Because, thanks to zero values, there’s no difference between any of these:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=115319>db.Update(id, database.Profile{})
db.Update(id, database.Profile{Name: &quot;&quot;})
db.Update(id, database.Profile{Bio: &quot;&quot;})
db.Update(id, database.Profile{Name: &quot;&quot;, Bio: &quot;&quot;})
</code><p data-bo="115498">So, let’s think of a way to address this. We could replace our <code>string</code> with
<code>*string</code> - pointers to a string.</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=115610>&#x2F;&#x2F; A Profile is a Profile.
type Profile struct {
  Name *string
  Bio  *string
}
</code><p data-bo="115702">And then… well then we have a bunch of things to worry about.</p>

<p data-bo="115767">First off, when we insert a <code>Profile</code>, we want to default to <code>&quot;&quot;</code> for all
fields, because that’s <em>still</em> our zero value:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=115889>func (db *DB) Insert(profile Profile) int64 {
  id := db.seed
  db.seed++
  if profile.Name == nil {
    var s = &quot;&quot;
    profile.Name = &amp;s
  }
  if profile.Bio == nil {
    var s = &quot;&quot;
    profile.Bio = &amp;s
  }
  db.records[id] = profile
  return id
}
</code><p data-bo="116149">And then in <code>Update</code>, we only update if non-nil:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=116199>func (db *DB) Update(id int64, profile Profile) {
  &#x2F;&#x2F; again, pretend this isn&#x27;t a `map[k]v` and we can update things in-place
  pf := db.records[id]
  changed := false
  if profile.Name != nil {
    pf.Name = profile.Name
    changed = true
  }
  if profile.Bio != nil {
    pf.Bio = profile.Bio
    changed = true
  }
  if changed {
    db.records[id] = pf
  }
}
</code><p data-bo="116575">So, where do we stand now?</p>

<p data-bo="116603">Well, everything is terribly unergonomic:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=116646>&#x2F;&#x2F; in `go-musings&#x2F;main.go`

package main

import (
  &quot;log&quot;

  &quot;go-musings&#x2F;database&quot;
)

func main() {
  db := database.NewDB()

  name := &quot;Lilibet&quot;
  bio := &quot;I don&#x27;t want even *want* to be queen and yet my sister is jealous.&quot;
  pf := database.Profile{
    Name: &amp;name,
    Bio:  &amp;bio,
  }
  id := db.Insert(pf)

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Remove the bio
  newBio := &quot;&quot;
  db.Update(id, database.Profile{Bio: &amp;newBio})

  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, db.Get(id))
}
</code><p data-bo="117086">But we can make a little <code>stringptr</code> function to help a little:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=117151>&#x2F;&#x2F; in `go-musings&#x2F;main.go`

package main

import (
  &quot;log&quot;

  &quot;go-musings&#x2F;database&quot;
)

func stringptr(s string) *string {
  return &amp;s
}

func main() {
  db := database.NewDB()

  pf := database.Profile{
    Name: stringptr(&quot;Lilibet&quot;),
    Bio:  stringptr(&quot;I don&#x27;t want even *want* to be queen and yet my sister is jealous.&quot;),
  }
  id := db.Insert(pf)

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Remove the bio
  db.Update(id, database.Profile{Bio: stringptr(&quot;&quot;)})

  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, db.Get(id))
}
</code><p data-bo="117624">And it <em>does</em> work:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=117645>$ go run main.go
2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 22:36:37 database.Profile{Name:(*string)(0xc0000961e0), Bio:(*string)(0xc000096200)}
</code><p data-bo="117769">Well.. it’s hard to tell that it works, because the default debug formatter
will <em>not</em> show you what a <code>*string</code> points to, but if we use something
slightly friendlier, like <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew">spew</a>:</p>

}
</code><p data-bo="118608">There! We did it!</p>

<p data-bo="118627">{% sc bearsays %}
🎉!
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="118664">Of course, all of that is only an option if you have the luxury of defining
the struct yourself.</p>

<p data-bo="118762">Which you don’t, if, for example, you use a code generator like the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a> compiler for Go,
which always generates <code>string</code> fields, even though in proto3 all fields are
optional.</p>

<p data-bo="118994">So, in that scenario, you have absolutely no way to tell between an “unset
field” and “the empty string”. Which, sure, doesn’t matter <em>most of the time</em>.</p>

<p data-bo="119149">Until it does, and well… what do you do then?</p>

<p data-bo="119198">Well, you signal whether a field is set or not out-of-band, of course!</p>

<p data-bo="119270">With something like:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=119292>type Profile struct {
  Name string
  HasName bool
  Bio string
  HasBio bool
}
</code><p data-bo="119383">Sounds ridiculous? Well, that’s exactly how Go maps work.</p>

<p data-bo="119442">If you have a <code>map[string]string</code>, and you try to get an entry that does not
exist you get… the zero value for a string, ie. <code>&quot;&quot;</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=119576>package main

import &quot;log&quot;

func main() {
  m := make(map[string]string)
  m[&quot;i-do-exist&quot;] = &quot;&quot;
  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, m[&quot;i-do-exist&quot;])
  log.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, m[&quot;i-do-not-exist&quot;])
}

2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 23:03:27 &quot;&quot;
</code><p data-bo="119840">How do you know if it’s <em>actually</em> in the map? Well, indexing a map actually
returns two values, so if you assign both of them, you can get that info - as
I mentioned, out of band:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=120022>package main

import &quot;log&quot;

func main() {
  m := make(map[string]string)
  m[&quot;i-do-exist&quot;] = &quot;&quot;

  {
    v, ok := m[&quot;i-do-exist&quot;]
    log.Printf(&quot;%#v, %#v&quot;, v, ok)
  }
  {
    v, ok := m[&quot;i-do-not-exist&quot;]
    log.Printf(&quot;%#v, %#v&quot;, v, ok)
  }
}
</code><code data-lang="shell" data-bo=120278>$ go run main.go
2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 23:05:03 &quot;&quot;, true
2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 23:05:03 &quot;&quot;, false
</code><p data-bo="120368">If you have a <code>string</code> and a <code>bool</code>, you have four possible combinations:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>the string is empty and the bool is <code>false</code></li>
<li>the string is empty and the bool is <code>true</code></li>
<li>the string is non-empty and the bool is <code>false</code></li>
<li>the string is non-empty and the bool is <code>true</code></li>
</ol>
<p data-bo="120638">Combination 3 is <em>never</em> returned when indexing a map in Go, but it’s…
there. It’s expressible. If we were able to implement our <em>own</em> data
structures that supported indexing, and the standard interface was something
like:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=120864>&#x2F;&#x2F; as of Go 1.15, generics are not a thing (*also* not the topic of this post)
&#x2F;&#x2F; anyway, use your imagination:
type K string
type V string
type Index interface {
  Get(k K) (V, bool)
}
</code><p data-bo="121061">…then nothing at all would prevent us from returning <code>&quot;lol&quot;, false</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="121133">Even without combination 3 being constructed, multi-return and out-of-band
“setness” signalling are the source of <em>so many</em> application bugs.</p>

<p data-bo="121276">Of course, it never segfaults. So it’s better than C, right? Because memory
safety, yay! It just silently does the wrong thing. So now vulnerabilities are
caused by logic errors instead of corrupted memory.</p>

<p data-bo="121484">{% sc bearsays %}
This <em>does</em> sound better, though.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="121549">{% sc amossays %}
Yeah. Then again, that’s a pretty low bar. Bash is memory-safe too!

Right… so is Excel. Hopefully?
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="121712">{% sc amossays %}
Hopefully.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="121754">One of the big selling point of Go is “we removed the footguns!” but… did
you? Seems like we just traded weapons. We’re <em>very much</em> still in “just be
careful” territory.</p>

<a id="just-don-t-write-bugs" href="#just-don-t-write-bugs" class="anchor"><h2>Just don’t write bugs!</h2></a>
<p data-bo="121954">And this leads me to one of the central points of this… <em>looks at time
estimate</em> this essay I guess.</p>

<p data-bo="122058">I made three claims about Rust earlier:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Programming in Rust requires you to think differently</li>
<li>It is harder to write any code at all in Rust</li>
<li>It is easier to write “correct” code in Rust</li>
</ol>
<p data-bo="122254">The first two claims are easy to accept for anyone trying out Rust for the
first time. The third one is another affair entirely.</p>

<p data-bo="122384">See, if all you have are the first two claims, it’s pretty easy to conclude
that Rustaceans are either masochists (which… who’s asking?) <em>or</em> that they
just like things that are hard because they’re hard and that makes them feel
clever.</p>

<p data-bo="122624">But here’s the thing: <strong>Rust is not specifically designed for clever people</strong>.</p>

<p data-bo="122704">Quite the contrary in fact. Look at me! Trying to make those subtle points
online! What a stupid, stupid idea. Only grief can come out of this. Clearly
“clever” is not a good descriptor here.</p>

<p data-bo="122897">The corollary of claim 3 is: <strong>it is harder to write “correct” code in other
languages</strong>. And by other languages, I’m again thinking in particular of
JavaScript, Ruby, Lua, Go, C, C#, Java, etc. - not Haskell.</p>

<p data-bo="123108">Here’s one thing that’s often said and <em>sounds</em> superior, but isn’t:
<strong>Learning Rust made me a better programmer</strong>.</p>

<p data-bo="123225">Mostly because, after many rounds of, uh, friendly negotiation with the
compiler, it’s made me so much more aware of the sheer amount of things that
can go wrong in a program.</p>

<p data-bo="123402">And it’s not like Rust <em>made</em> me paranoid. I was aware of <em>most</em> of these
failure conditions before picking up Rust. But the Rust compiler forces you
to address these upfront.</p>

<p data-bo="123579">The whole language encourages you to model your program in such a way that
you don’t leave anything to chance. That things that should not happen are
either not modelled at all, handled explicitly, or halt the program safely.</p>

<p data-bo="123806">In Rust, if you have a “string” field that must be set, you just say this:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=123882>struct Person {
  name: String,
}
</code><p data-bo="123929">It <em>has</em> to be initialized. It doesn’t just default to the empty string.</p>

<p data-bo="124003">This is a compile error:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=124029>fn main() {
    let p = Person {};
}

  |             ^^^^^^ missing `name`
</code><p data-bo="124335">If you <em>want</em> it to default to the empty string, you can implement the
<code>Default</code> trait for your struct, and <em>explicitly</em> say that it should
use the default values for any unspecified fields:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=124527>#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Person {

    };
    dbg!(p);
}
</code><code data-lang="shell" data-bo=124687>$ cargo run -q
[src&#x2F;main.rs:10] p = Person {
    name: &quot;&quot;,
}
</code><p data-bo="124762">And if that field is optional… well you explicitly make it optional:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=124834>#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Person {
        name: Some(&quot;Elizabeth&quot;.into()),
    };
    dbg!(p);
    let p = Person {
        ..Default::default()
    };
    dbg!(p);
}

</code><p data-bo="125084">In which case the field is either <code>Some(&quot;some string&quot;)</code>, or <code>None</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=125153>$ cargo run -q
[src&#x2F;main.rs:10] p = Person {
    name: Some(
        &quot;Elizabeth&quot;,
    ),
}
[src&#x2F;main.rs:14] p = Person {
    name: None,
}
</code><p data-bo="125306">And that’s also the way a <code>HashMap</code> works. When indexing a <code>HashMap</code>, you
either get a <code>Some(value)</code>, or a <code>None</code>. It only returns “one thing”.</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=125451>use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map: HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; = Default::default();
    map.insert(&quot;i-exist&quot;.into(), &quot;yay&quot;.into());

    dbg!(map.get(&quot;i-exist&quot;));
    dbg!(map.get(&quot;i-do-not-exist&quot;));
}
</code><code data-lang="shell" data-bo=125689>$ cargo run -q
[src&#x2F;main.rs:7] map.get(&quot;i-exist&quot;) = Some(
    &quot;yay&quot;,
)
[src&#x2F;main.rs:8] map.get(&quot;i-do-not-exist&quot;) = None
</code><p data-bo="125823">And you can’t accidentally pretend you got a value when you really didn’t -
you need to handle both cases, one way or the other:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=125953>use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map: HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; = Default::default();
    map.insert(&quot;foo&quot;.into(), &quot;bar&quot;.into());

    &#x2F;&#x2F; stops program with a generic error message if value isn&#x27;t `Some`
    print_str(map.get(&quot;foo&quot;).unwrap());

    &#x2F;&#x2F; stops program with a custom error message if value isn&#x27;t `Some`
    print_str(map.get(&quot;foo&quot;).expect(&quot;we wanted foo to be set&quot;));

    &#x2F;&#x2F; only executed if return value is `Some`
    if let Some(s) = map.get(&quot;foo&quot;) {
        print_str(s);
    }

    &#x2F;&#x2F; handles both cases explicitly
    match map.get(&quot;foo&quot;) {
        Some(s) =&gt; {
            print_str(s);
        }
        None =&gt; {

        }
    }

[src&#x2F;main.rs:27] s = &quot;bar&quot;
</code><p data-bo="126842">All this isn’t at the expense of performance, either. An <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code> is the
same size as a <code>*const T</code> - it’s just <code>None</code> if the pointer is null.</p>

<p data-bo="126989">{% sc tip %}
You normally wouldn’t experience raw pointers unless you’re writing <code>unsafe</code>
code on purpose, when doing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html">FFI</a> for example.

<p data-bo="127183">This is just one of the <em>many</em> ways Rust lets you model what actually happens
in your program. And once you’re past the initial frustration, and you really
see the value proposition, everything else feels terribly uncomfortable.</p>

<p data-bo="127413">Writing JavaScript and Go is <em>terrifying</em> to me now. All the pitfalls I

<p data-bo="127653">Which of course never actually works.</p>

<p data-bo="127692">Proponents of the “just be careful” mantra (C advocates in particular) will

programmer - as if we were all engaged in some permanent game of battle

<p data-bo="127919">This is, to put it mildly, self-aggrandizing horseshit.</p>

<p data-bo="127976">Engineering is not about “not doing mistakes”. Engineering is about <strong>designing

<p data-bo="128101">Rust is such a system.</p>

<a id="i-think-we-were-talking-about-http" href="#i-think-we-were-talking-about-http" class="anchor"><h2>I think we were talking about HTTP?</h2></a>
<p data-bo="128165">Right! HTTP.</p>

<p data-bo="128179">Let’s take another look at some of the data structures used to represent HTTP
requests and responses in Go.</p>

<p data-bo="128288">We’ve already discussed <code>Request.Header</code>, which is a <code>map[string][]string</code> in
disguise. But it doesn’t end there.</p>

<p data-bo="128403">For incoming requests, the protocol version is stored in no less than three fields!</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=128488>  &#x2F;&#x2F; The protocol version for incoming server requests.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, these fields are ignored. The HTTP
  &#x2F;&#x2F; client code always uses either HTTP&#x2F;1.1 or HTTP&#x2F;2.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; See the docs on Transport for details.
  Proto      string &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;1.0&quot;
  ProtoMajor int    &#x2F;&#x2F; 1
  ProtoMinor int    &#x2F;&#x2F; 0
</code><p data-bo="128805">Again, that means we can construct nonsensical inputs, like:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=128867>  req := Request {
    Proto: &quot;HTTP&#x2F;1.1&quot;,
    ProtoMajor: 2,
    ProtoMinor: 0,
  }
</code><p data-bo="128962">One slightly more correct way to do it would be to have a separate struct
type, <code>HTTPVersion</code>, that only stores the Major and Minor version:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=129104>  type HTTPVersion struct {
    Major int
    Minor int
  }
</code><p data-bo="129175">…and have it implement <code>String()</code>, so you can have a String representation
whenever needed:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=129270>  func (hv HTTPVersion) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;HTTP&#x2F;%v.%v&quot;, hv.Major, hv.Minor)
  }
</code><p data-bo="129384">Although that would still leave several issues: you could still build
non-existent (definitely non-supported) versions of HTTP, like <code>4.-7</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="129526">You could also <em>still</em> mutate <code>Major</code> and <code>Minor</code>, since they’re public
(exported) fields, so in Go, you’d have no choice but to unexport them and
add getters - and then you’d need a constructor, too:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=129728>  type HTTPVersion struct {
    major int
    minor int
  }

  func NewHTTPVersion(major int, minor int) HTTPVersion {
    return HTTPVersion { major, minor }
  }

  func (hv HTTPVersion) Major() int {
    return hv.major
  }

  func (hv HTTPVersion) Minor() int {
    return hv.minor
  }
</code><p data-bo="130028">Let’s look at other fields, like… <code>ContentLength</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=130082>  &#x2F;&#x2F; ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
  &#x2F;&#x2F; Values &gt;= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
  &#x2F;&#x2F; be read from Body.
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, a value of 0 with a non-nil Body is
  &#x2F;&#x2F; also treated as unknown.
  ContentLength int64
</code><p data-bo="130418">Mhhh, using <code>-1</code> to signal that the length is unknown. Sounds familiar?</p>

<p data-bo="130491">We’re using in-band signalling now! Reserving some values to indicate
specific conditions. What does a value of -2 through -9223372036854775808
mean?</p>

<p data-bo="130642">It goes on:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=130655>  &#x2F;&#x2F; URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
  &#x2F;&#x2F; requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For server requests, the URL is parsed from the URI
  &#x2F;&#x2F; supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For
  &#x2F;&#x2F; most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
  &#x2F;&#x2F; empty. (See RFC 7230, Section 5.3)
  &#x2F;&#x2F;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; For client requests, the URL&#x27;s Host specifies the server to
  &#x2F;&#x2F; connect to, while the Request&#x27;s Host field optionally
  &#x2F;&#x2F; specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
  &#x2F;&#x2F; request.
  URL *url.URL
</code><p data-bo="131232">More dual-purpose fields! For client requests, <code>URL</code> is the full, absolute
URL you want to request, and so the Host is set.</p>

<p data-bo="131357">But for server requests, <code>URL</code> is just a relative URL, and it’s the <code>Host</code>
field that counts.</p>

<p data-bo="131452">Why? I don’t know! You tell me! All the pieces were there!</p>

<p data-bo="131512">Speaking of <code>URL</code>, here’s its definition:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=131555>type URL struct {
  Scheme      string
  Opaque      string    &#x2F;&#x2F; encoded opaque data
  User        *Userinfo &#x2F;&#x2F; username and password information
  Host        string    &#x2F;&#x2F; host or host:port
  Path        string    &#x2F;&#x2F; path (relative paths may omit leading slash)
  RawPath     string    &#x2F;&#x2F; encoded path hint (see EscapedPath method)
  ForceQuery  bool      &#x2F;&#x2F; append a query (&#x27;?&#x27;) even if RawQuery is empty
  RawQuery    string    &#x2F;&#x2F; encoded query values, without &#x27;?&#x27;
  Fragment    string    &#x2F;&#x2F; fragment for references, without &#x27;#&#x27;
  RawFragment string    &#x2F;&#x2F; encoded fragment hint (see EscapedFragment method)
}
</code><p data-bo="132179">At a glance, just looking at this definition, try to guess - how should you
build a fragment?</p>

<p data-bo="132274">As as reminder, a “fragment” is the part of the URL that is not sent to the
server, it’s only accessible to the user agent:</p>

<code data-lang="raw" data-bo=132399>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org?query#fragment
                         ^^^^^^^^^
</code><p data-bo="132481">So, when building a <code>URL</code> to be formatted, should we set <code>Fragment</code> or <code>RawFragment</code>?</p>

<p data-bo="132568">Well, we can look at <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#URL.String">the documentation for
<code>URL.String()</code></a>. As usual with Go APIs
that “look simple”, it’s not:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="132723"><code>String</code> reassembles the URL into a valid URL string.</p>

<p data-bo="132781">The general form of the result is one of:</p>

<code data-lang="" data-bo=132827>scheme:opaque?query#fragment
scheme:&#x2F;&#x2F;userinfo@host&#x2F;path?query#fragment
</code><p data-bo="132917">If <code>u.Opaque</code> is non-empty, <code>String</code> uses the first form; otherwise it uses the
second form. Any non-ASCII characters in host are escaped. To obtain the
path, <code>String</code> uses <code>u.EscapedPath()</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="133117">In the second form, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul><li>if <code>u.Scheme</code> is empty, scheme: is omitted.</li>
<li>if <code>u.User</code> is nil, userinfo@ is omitted.</li>
<li>if <code>u.Host</code> is empty, host&#x2F; is omitted.</li>
<li>if <code>u.Scheme</code> and <code>u.Host</code> are empty and <code>u.User</code> is nil,
the entire scheme:&#x2F;&#x2F;userinfo@host&#x2F; is omitted.</li>
<li>if <code>u.Host</code> is non-empty and <code>u.Path</code> begins with a &#x2F;,
the form host&#x2F;path does not add its own &#x2F;.</li>
<li>if <code>u.RawQuery</code> is empty, ?query is omitted.</li>
<li>if <code>u.Fragment</code> is empty, #fragment is omitted.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p data-bo="133625">The answer was <code>u.Fragment</code>, because <code>URL</code> escapes it, via… <code>EscapedFragment()</code>, which
has this documentation:</p>

<blockquote><p data-bo="133741"><code>EscapedFragment</code> returns the escaped form of <code>u.Fragment</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="133805">In general there are multiple possible escaped forms of any fragment.</p>

<p data-bo="133879"><code>EscapedFragment</code> returns <code>u.RawFragment</code> when it is a valid escaping of <code>u.Fragment</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="133970">Otherwise <code>EscapedFragment</code> ignores <code>u.RawFragment</code> and computes an escaped
form on its own.</p>

<p data-bo="134069">The <code>String</code> method uses <code>EscapedFragment</code> to construct its result. In general, code
should call <code>EscapedFragment</code> instead of reading <code>u.RawFragment</code> directly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-bo="134232">So, to get the full picture, we had to look at the definition of the <code>URL</code>
struct, its <code>String()</code> method, and, to further understand what <code>String()</code>
does, its <code>EscapedFragment()</code> method. That’s assuming the documentation is
up-to-date.</p>

<p data-bo="134469">Maintaining <em>both</em> the escaped and non-escaped fragment might make sense from
a performance standpoint - if you parse an incoming request and forward it
somewhere else, there’s no need to re-escape the fragment, you can just
forward the “raw fragment” you got in the first place.</p>

<p data-bo="134750">But by storing both as exported fields and letting the user manipulate
either, the designers of this bit of the Go API have drawn themselves into a
corner, where they had to add complicated semantics to all functions that
touch either variant of the fragment so that it “makes sense most of the
time”.</p>

<p data-bo="135053">I’m going to stop showing you Go APIs now because I’ve used up my sigh
reserve, but if you’re brave enough to keep looking at them, you’ll see
those patterns used <em>all over</em>.</p>

<p data-bo="135229">Reading those and thinking, <em>really thinking</em> about the implications of their
design is going to be more convincing than any amount of material I can
personally write, so, by all means, go and do it.</p>

<p data-bo="135430">But before you do - let’s look at how some of these problems are modelled
by popular Rust crates for HTTP.</p>

<a id="a-look-at-hyper" href="#a-look-at-hyper" class="anchor"><h2>A look at hyper</h2></a>
<p data-bo="135558"><a href="https://lib.rs/crates/hyper">hyper</a> is one of my favorite crates. But I
could say that about a lot of crates.</p>

<p data-bo="135673">It’s a low-level HTTP library, consisting of quality building blocks.</p>

<p data-bo="135744">Let’s look at the definition of a <code>Request</code> in hyper:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=135799>pub struct Request&lt;T&gt; {
    head: Parts,
    body: T,
}
</code><p data-bo="135868">Okay, so a <code>Request</code> is generic over its body type. Why? Because the body can
be anything. It can be a string in memory, or it can be a bunch of bytes
(a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> or equivalent), also in memory, or it can be a File, from which
you can read, or it can be another thing that can be streamed.</p>

<p data-bo="136160">The only requirement for a body is that you can poll it for data and trailers
(because yes, trailing HTTP headers are a thing which we <em>will not</em> discuss).</p>

<p data-bo="136317">Then there’s the head, a <code>Parts</code>:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=136352>&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; Component parts of an HTTP `Request`
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The HTTP request head consists of a method, uri, version, and a set of
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; header fields.
pub struct Parts {
    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The request&#x27;s method
    pub method: Method,

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The request&#x27;s URI
    pub uri: Uri,

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The request&#x27;s version
    pub version: Version,

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The request&#x27;s headers
    pub headers: HeaderMap&lt;HeaderValue&gt;,

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; The request&#x27;s extensions
    pub extensions: Extensions,

    _priv: (),
}
</code><p data-bo="136834">Interesting! There’s no <code>host</code> field here. Only a <code>uri</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="136892">The <code>method</code> field is an opaque type:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=136931>#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct Method(Inner);
</code><p data-bo="137008">…that wraps a private enum, which accommodates well-known HTTP methods
<em>and</em> extensions:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=137100>#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
enum Inner {
    Options,
    Get,
    Post,
    Put,
    Delete,
    Head,
    Trace,
    Connect,
    Patch,
    &#x2F;&#x2F; If the extension is short enough, store it inline
    ExtensionInline([u8; MAX_INLINE], u8),
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Otherwise, allocate it
    ExtensionAllocated(Box&lt;[u8]&gt;),
}
</code><p data-bo="137429">{% sc tip %}
A trick similar to the <code>smartstring</code> crate is used here.</p>

<p data-bo="137500">You can read more about it in <a href="/articles/peeking-inside-a-rust-enum">Peeking inside a Rust enum</a>.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="137611">The <code>version</code> field is an opaque type:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=137651>pub struct Version(Http);

impl Version {
    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; `HTTP&#x2F;0.9`
    pub const HTTP_09: Version = Version(Http::Http09);

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; `HTTP&#x2F;1.0`
    pub const HTTP_10: Version = Version(Http::Http10);

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; `HTTP&#x2F;1.1`
    pub const HTTP_11: Version = Version(Http::Http11);

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; `HTTP&#x2F;2.0`
    pub const HTTP_2: Version = Version(Http::H2);

    &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; `HTTP&#x2F;3.0`
    pub const HTTP_3: Version = Version(Http::H3);
}
</code><p data-bo="138077">..which wraps a private enum, containing all the supported versions of HTTP:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=138155>#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd, Copy, Clone, Eq, Ord, Hash)]
enum Http {
    Http09,
    Http10,
    Http11,
    H2,
    H3,
    __NonExhaustive,
}
</code><p data-bo="138316">…and provides a <code>Debug</code> implementation to format it as a string:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=138384>impl fmt::Debug for Version {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter&lt;&#x27;_&gt;) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        use self::Http::*;

        f.write_str(match self.0 {
            Http09 =&gt; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;0.9&quot;,
            Http10 =&gt; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;1.0&quot;,
            Http11 =&gt; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;1.1&quot;,
            H2 =&gt; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;2.0&quot;,
            H3 =&gt; &quot;HTTP&#x2F;3.0&quot;,
            __NonExhaustive =&gt; unreachable!(),
        })
    }
}
</code><p data-bo="138781">Note that there is absolutely no way (in safe code) to construct an HTTP
version that’s meaningless.</p>

<p data-bo="138883">But what’s particularly interesting is how HTTP headers are represented.</p>

<p data-bo="138957">The <code>headers</code> field is of type <code>HeaderMap</code> which is defined as follows:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=139030>pub struct HeaderMap&lt;T = HeaderValue&gt; {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Used to mask values to get an index
    mask: Size,
    indices: Box&lt;[Pos]&gt;,
    entries: Vec&lt;Bucket&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
    extra_values: Vec&lt;ExtraValue&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
    danger: Danger,
}
</code><p data-bo="139256">Well.. it’s not a <code>Vec&lt;(String, String)&gt;</code>. And it’s not a <code>HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="139342">It’s not a <code>HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> either.</p>

<p data-bo="139393">It’s a <em>multimap</em> (like a hashmap, but each key can have multiple values), of
<code>HeaderName</code> to <code>HeaderValue</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="139503">All through <code>hyper</code>, we’re following the principle of “you can only build
something that’s meaningful”.</p>

<p data-bo="139608">So for example, in Go you can do this:</p>

<code data-lang="go" data-bo=139648>package main

import (
  &quot;fmt&quot;
  &quot;net&#x2F;http&quot;
  &quot;strings&quot;
)

func main() {
  headers := make(http.Header)
  headers.Add(&quot;Host&quot;, &quot;example.org&quot;)
  headers.Add(&quot;Née&quot;, &quot;élégante&quot;)

  sb := new(strings.Builder)
  headers.Write(sb)
  fmt.Printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, sb)
}
</code><p data-bo="139913">And generate non-compliant HTTP headers:</p>

<code data-lang="shell" data-bo=139955>$ go run main.go
Host: example.org
Née: élégante
</code><p data-bo="140021">But when using hyper in Rust, you can’t build it.</p>

<p data-bo="140072">The following is a compile-time error:</p>

<code data-lang="rust" data-bo=140112>use hyper::HeaderMap;

fn main() {
    let mut headers = HeaderMap::new();

<p data-bo="145211">A fair question - since that message wasn’t printed it’s safe to assume that
“élégante” is <em>not</em> in fact, an invalid header value. Let’s check the
documentation of <code>HeaderValue</code> to see what’s up:</p>

<code data-lang="" data-bo=145410>&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; Represents an HTTP header field value.
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; In practice, HTTP header field values are usually valid ASCII. However, the
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; HTTP spec allows for a header value to contain opaque bytes as well. In this
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; case, the header field value is not able to be represented as a string.
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; To handle this, the `HeaderValue` is useable as a type and can be compared
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; with strings and implements `Debug`. A `to_str` fn is provided that returns
&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; an `Err` if the header value contains non visible ascii characters.
</code><p data-bo="145938">AhAH! So HTTP <em>does</em> allow non-ASCII headers, but they’re not “strings”, so
<code>HeaderValue::from_static</code> disallows them.</p>

<p data-bo="146058">However, if we switch from <code>HeaderMap::insert</code> to <code>HeaderMap::append</code>, we can

</code><p data-bo="146919">Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m impressed. I didn’t even <em>know</em> that
hyper did that. But when you have a language that lets you model a problem
properly, it’s not exactly a surprise when people do.</p>

<p data-bo="147123">And that’s an important point as well - you <em>could</em> have a Rust HTTP
implementation that just uses <code>HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> - but why do
that when you can have a high-performance multimap, which is fast in the 90%
case and still correct the rest of the time?</p>

<p data-bo="147389">{% sc tip %}
<code>hyper</code> even goes so far as to have enum values for common headers, so
there’s no allocation required to store the name of headers like
“accept-charset”, “host”, or “www-authenticate”.
{% endsc %}</p>

<p data-bo="147600">And you <em>could</em> have a Go HTTP library that has a slightly better structure
than the official one… and in fact <a href="https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp">people have done exactly
that</a> - but then you lose out on a
<em>huge</em> part of the ecosystem because this is not a thing Go encourages. At
all.</p>

<p data-bo="147892">In Go, we just want most things to work out most of the time. And if they really
don’t, well… we can probably just patch it. And if we can’t, well, we’re in
deep trouble but we could always just write <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator">a code generator</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="148202">As I’ve mentioned before, a lot of discussions around programming languages
quickly becomes heated - it’s as if we’re cheering for sports teams instead
of discussing systems.</p>

<p data-bo="148378">I’m wholly uninterested in cheering for a team. I am <em>very</em> interested in
systems that prevent mistakes, or even better, <em>entire classes</em> of mistakes.</p>

<p data-bo="148530">When you hear someone talk about how much they love Rust, once they’ve really
started loving it, it’s hard to take it at face value - especially if you’ve
already practiced different programming languages before.</p>

<p data-bo="148744">If you’ve been following industry trends (because, well, of the job market),
you’ve probably experienced Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, etc.</p>

<p data-bo="148894">And while there are significant differences between these languages, in terms
of how effective they are at letting you model a problem “correctly”… it’s
not night and day.</p>

<p data-bo="149069">You might have to write a lot more assertions in C, boilerplate in Java, and
write a lot more tests in dynamic languages, but they’re more or less all
equally permissive in terms of letting you “construct impossible values”,
which <em>cannot</em> be processed meaningfully and end up polluting your whole
codebase with unending validation - if you care enough to do it, anyway.</p>

<p data-bo="149441">In terms of modelling a problem, Rust really is <em>several steps</em> above those
languages. But it’s not alien technology - it’s not completely removed from
existing systems, in an ivory tower. It exists as a compromise, that
significantly improves the status quo <em>and</em> integrates well.</p>

<p data-bo="149724">This is what makes Rust unique to me. Of course Rust was strongly influenced
by languages that came before it. Again: the value is in the compromise.</p>

<p data-bo="149875">Memory management is a particularly big hurdle for folks moving from the
languages I mentioned - I’ve argued before that it’s not manual memory
management, it’s more <a href="/articles/declarative-memory-management">declarative memory
management</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="150116">But much like most of what Rust provides, you can opt into it over time.</p>

<p data-bo="150190">It’s fine to prototype something with <code>String</code> and <code>clone</code> whenever you need
to. Or use an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Arc.html">Arc</a>. And later
you can figure out if it’s worth replacing with some borrowed types, for
performance. You don’t have to come up with the most performance design
upfront (even though it’s real tempting!).</p>

<p data-bo="150546">Over time, though, if you commit to writing Rust and trying to really go all
the way into what it <em>encourages</em> you to do (write safe, correct code),
you’ll find yourself thinking differently: writing types and function
signatures first, implementations later.</p>

<p data-bo="150807">But also, restructuring your program so that state is neatly separated, so
you don’t get into heated discussion with the borrow checker. Fields will
start being grouped by “mutation affinity” rather than by “theme”, as you may
have done in other languages previously. You’ll end up naming quite a few
structs <code>State</code>.</p>

<p data-bo="151126">It really is a wonderful journey, and even if you still have to write other
languages for your day job, the experience you’ll acquire learning Rust is
applicable in other languages too - even C++!</p>

<p data-bo="151324">Hopefully this article doesn’t just add to the pile - it’s hard to advocate
for a solution without pointing how other solutions fail to address specific
problems, so a bit of comparison was unavoidable.</p>

<p data-bo="151528">If you want to learn Rust, there are <em>many</em> excellent resources online,
like the official <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">Rust book</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="151672">If you enjoyed my writing, there’s <a href="/tags/rust">a lot more of it</a> specific to
Rust. I even have <a href="/series">entire series</a>.</p>

<p data-bo="151795">No matter your path to Rust, I guarantee you’ll at least learn <em>something</em>
that is applicable to your trade elsewhere. And if you don’t, well, you
can always <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">contribute to it</a>!</p>
